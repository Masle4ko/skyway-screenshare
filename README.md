## Setting up

Use `npm install` to set up dependencies.

## Contributing

Make sure you have nodejs installed. Run `npm install` to get started.

After making changes in `src/`, you run

- `npm run lint` to validate
- `npm test` to run tests

then the `npm run build` and build `screenshare(.min).js` which is stored in `dist` directory!
